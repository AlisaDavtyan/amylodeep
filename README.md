# ðŸ§¬ AmyloDeep: Deep learning-based ensemble model for predicting amyloid propensity from the amino acid sequence


**AmyloDeep** is a deep learning-powered tool that predicts the amyloid-forming propensity of protein sequences using transformer-based protein embeddings. Amyloids are Î²-sheet-rich, stable structures that play roles in both critical biological functions (like memory and immunity) and serious diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s, Parkinsonâ€™s, and Huntingtonâ€™s.

AmyloDeep provides reliable predictions of amyloidogenic regions directly from the amino acid sequence.
